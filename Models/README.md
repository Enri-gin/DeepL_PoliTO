# FOLDER CONTAINING ALL THE MODELS DESCRIBED IN THE PROJECT
**GIANNI' CASSAI MALLALIU**

- `hand_model.pth`: state dictionary of the trained hand model
- `best_random_search.pth`: state dictionary of the trained random search model
- `best_model_evo.pth`: state dictionary of the trained model from evolutionary algorithm

 
In the population folder there are
- `initial_population`: Initial population of the genetic algorithm
- `history` files that are list of lists, where each list represent an individual of the different approaches
- `naswot` files that is a list where each element is the naswot score of the models
- `synflow_`files list where each element is the log-synflow score of the models
